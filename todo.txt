Zope security: "principle" instead of "user"?
Zope: not know the difference between an abstraction
and a confusing synonym. Equated obscurity with abstraction.

When I do Facade, take quotes from:

"The key in making great and growable systems is much more to design how its
modules communicate rather than what their internal properties and
behaviors should be"

Can I use this?

"Take some sort of "Loader" for example. The focus here is on the unit
of work it does. It'll have lots of instance variables, lots of
arguments, and pass lots of data around probably. Now instead replace
that with a LoadRecord and a LoadStream. I'm reasonably confident you'll
end up with something that is more akin to what the original Founding
Fathers of OOP had in mind. We want to create objects that describe what
they are, and then bind behavior to them, rather than focus on what they
do, and then figure out what data they'll need to do that."
